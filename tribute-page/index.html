            <p>Mangal Pandey was an Indian soldier who played a key part in the events immediately preceding the
                outbreak of the Indian rebellion of 1857. He was a sepoy (infantryman) in the 34th Bengal Native
                Infantry (BNI) regiment of the British East India Company. In 1984, the Indian government issued a
                postage stamp to remember him. His life and actions have also been portrayed in several cinematic
                productions.</p>
                <h3>Here's a time line of Mangal Pandey's life:</h3>
            <div id="timeline">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1827</strong> - born in Nagwa, a village of upper Ballia district, Uttar Pradesh, to a
                        Hindu Brahmin family.</li>
                    <li><strong>1849</strong> - Mangal Pandey had joined the Bengal Army."</li>
                    <li><strong>mid-1850s</strong> - a new Enfield rifle was introduced into India that required a
                        soldier to bite off the ends of greased cartridges in order to load the weapon. A rumour spread
                        that the lubricant used was either cow or pig lard, which was repugnant to Hindus or Muslims,
                        respectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>March 29, 1857</strong> - Mangal Pandey, was pacing in front of the regiment's guard
                        room by the parade ground, armed with a loaded musket, calling upon the men to rebel and
                        threatening to shoot the first European that he set eyes on.</li>
                    <li><strong>8 April 1857</strong> - Mangal Pandey's execution took place.</li>
                </ul>
